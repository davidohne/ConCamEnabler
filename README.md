# Continuity Camera Enabler
This script/app enables the Continuity Camera feature of your iOS device under macOS Ventura after your disconnected the device.
Normally you need to restart your mac, put it back to sleep or connect your iOS device via cable.

This tiny tiny app only restarts the Continuity Camera Agent and that's all the magic: Continuity Camera is working right after you pressed Disconnect...

# How To
- Open the .SCPT file and review it in the AppleScript Editor
- Press File --> Export --> FileFormat: Application --> Check: Run-Only --> Code Sign: Sign to run locally --> Save to the location you want
- Result: You got your own app to "enable" the Continuity Camera again
